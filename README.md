Converting to Grayscale:
Description: The image is transformed from color to grayscale to simplify the intensity variations, focusing on luminance rather than color.

Inverting the Grayscale Image:
Description: The grayscale image is inverted to create a negative, emphasizing dark areas as light and vice versa.

Applying Gaussian Blur:
Description: A Gaussian blur is applied to the inverted image to smooth out fine details and create a softer effect, which mimics the blending seen in pencil sketches.

Inverting the Blurred Image:
Description: The blurred image is inverted to prepare it for the final sketch effect, creating a positive of the blurred negative.

Creating the Pencil Sketch:
Description: The original grayscale image is divided by the inverted blurred image to produce a pencil sketch effect, highlighting edges and shading.

Displaying the Pencil Sketch:
Description: The processed image is displayed in grayscale to visualize the final pencil sketch effect.
